The purpose of the project is to create a modern open source reimplementation of the engine used in the 1996 video game Diablo.\\
It will use the original data files, so as to avoid issues with copyright, but will also
support modern file formats, and be a generic engine for games of that style.\\
The original game is an isometric top down hack and slash game, which features some roguelike elements, such as
random items and dungeons. These will be a focus of the project.
