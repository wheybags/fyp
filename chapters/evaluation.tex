\chapter{Evaluation}
	The features implemented in the current version of the freeablo engine are as follows:\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Isometric tile rendering}
		\item{CEL/CL2 file loading}
		\item{Mouse movement}
		\item{Level loading}
		\item{Level switching}
		\item{NPC placement}
		\item{Level Generation}
		\item{Enemy placement}
		\item{Basic collision detection}
		\item{Player character display}
		\item{Animation}
	\end{itemize}
	
	The main file formats have been reverse engineered, and the Level and Cel namespaces contain code for decoding them. The freeablo game engine successfully takes the assets decoded by these, and implements an isometric renderer capable fo displaying them as a game world. The FALevelGen component takes care of the last major concer, which is of course level generation.
