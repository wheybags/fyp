    	It does not appear to have any embedded scripting language.

    	\subsubsection{ProjectDDT}
    	ProjectDDT\cite{ddt} is an existing attempt to create a modern FOSS engone for Diablo.
    	It has been abandoned now since 2011.
    	I have decided to create my own project, in favour of continuing work on this, because it is extremely badly engineered.
    	For example: the creator of this work decided not to use header files, but simply placed function declarations at the start of files where he needed them.
    	The code is also just generally not very readable, and he has a tendency to not create classes where they would have been appropriate.
    	It is however, very useful as a reference, as it is under the GPL.
    	It contains code for loading and interpreting several diablo file formats, which while hard to follow, is still extremely useful.
