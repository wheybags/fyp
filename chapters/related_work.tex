    \section{Relevant existing FOSS Isometric Engines}
    	\subsection{Flare Isometric Engine}
    	Flare\cite{flare} is an open source isometric hack and slash game engine. It uses the SDL library for displaying graphics, and simple text based file formats.
    	It does not appear to have any embedded scripting language.
    	
    	\subsection{Holyspirit}
    	Holyspirit\cite{holyspirit} claims to be in alpha. It uses the SFML library. Does not appear to support networking.
    	Developed in French.
    	
    	\subsection{Fifengine}
    	Fifengine\cite{fife} (Flexible Isometric Free Engine) is a FOSS generic isometric game engine.
    	It supports python scripting, and the UI is skinnable with xml.
    	It uses SDL and opengl. It does not support networking.
    	
    	\subsection{ProjectDDT}
    	ProjectDDT\cite{ddt} is an existing attempt to create a modern FOSS engine for Diablo.
    	It has been abandoned now since 2011.
    	Extending this project was considered over creating a new one, but this was decided against as the existing code appears unmaintainable and quite hard to follow.
    	It is however, very useful as a reference, as it is under the GPL.
    	It contains code for loading and interpreting several diablo file formats which proved useful.
    	
    	\subsection{Diablo 1 HD Mod}
    	This\cite{d1hd} is another recreation of the diablo engine that is far more advanced than ProjectDDT. The game appears to be fully playable. However, the source code is not available, and there does not appear to be any plans for it to be made so at any point.
